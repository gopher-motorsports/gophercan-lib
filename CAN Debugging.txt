Helpful steps for debugging CAN:

HARDWARE
 - use scope at every pin to make sure the bus is acting as expected
 - use CANalyzer RX and TX pins on the CAN transiever for the STM32 to make sure it works as it should (scope CAN_H / CAN_L)
 - Make sure to terminate bus (120ohm resistors), will be buggy without it (but not completely broken, which can be confusing)

SOFTWARE
 - MAKE SURE TO CONFIGURE TIMERS AND CAN TIMINGS CORRECTLY (http://www.bittiming.can-wiki.info/)
 - CAN Loopback mode (check datasheet for explanation) to make sure TX works correctly before debugging RX
 - CANalyzer and scope to check TX
 - Use another STM32 in loopback mode to transmit while debugging RX, CANalyzer cannot transmit 29bit IDs
 - STM32 debugger is great, use it (lots of small config bugs were found very quickly with it)
 - Keep datasheet open to check to make sure registers are configured as expected
 - Very slow (500ms) background loops to make reading CAN outputs easier for humans
