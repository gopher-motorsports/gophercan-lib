GopherCAN TODO list:
 AUTO-GEN TOOL
 - Tool that will auto-generate code from the .XLSX table
 - Split up auto generated sections of .c/.h ?

 MAYBE DO
 - TCP functionality for important commands
 - double precision floats
 - Possible #ifdefs for what CAN messages/parameters each modual should handle (spreadsheet based, auto-gen)
 - Module specific variables (parameter sections, subscribe to different lists)
 - Module groups (like an email list)

 SHOULD DO
 - Typedefs for modules, parameters, errors, ect
 - Fault Parameters

TESTS:
 GENERAL TESTS
 - [_] TEST basic RX and TX of parameters
 - [_] TEST to make sure buffers are working correctly
 - [_] TEST adding messages to front of buffer
 - [_] TEST filling up the buffers gives the correct errors
 - [_] TEST CAN commands
 - [x] TEST all datatypes
 - [x] TEST more usage of logic based param requests
 - [x] TEST what happens when the bus is at high load (lower priority messages will be stuck in the TX mailbox, keep the bus clean)
 - [x] TEST how the code handles full RX and TX mailboxes (TX: Waits until the next 1ms loop to send. RX: Message in position 3 is deleted for the new message)
 - [x] TEST command errors working correctly
 - [x] TEST request errors working correctly
 - [x] TEST lots of messages being sent to a single module at once (Its pretty good, bus is the limitation)
 - [_] TEST parameter sending function
 - [_] TEST requesting a param that is not enabled (should send an error)
 - [_] TEST FIFO1 (fill up FIFO0 first)
 - [_] TEST Delta time of request vs recieve for a loaded and unloaded bus
 - [_] TEST cpu usage with no filter
 - [_] TEST module requesting data from a disabled param on another module
 - [_] TEST general destination CAN messages (ID 0)
 - [_] TEST filters, including general filter
 - [_] TEST multiple busses on the F7xx (in general, no routing)

 ROUTER TESTS
 - [_] TEST basic RX and TX on different busses
 - [_] TEST RX and TX with the DLM
 - [_] TEST really full bus with lots of routing required
 - [_] TEST step through routing logic to make sure everything is working as expected
 - [_] TEST smart routing functionality
 - [_] TEST 3 busses
 - [_] TEST Routing general target messages

NOTES FOR DEVS:
 - Last_rx and HAL_GetTick() is U32 milliseconds, meaning things may break after ~49.7 days
 - If things don't seem to be working correctly, CHECK THE BUS UTILIZATION.
     Requests may not be completed if the bus is packed. This is the most likely reason something is not working from testing
 - Set the RX and TX buffer sizes appropriately for the expected RX and TX loads. They don't need to be very big (~16)
 - Beware of asking for too many params/commands very quickly:
     The TX buffer could fill up and new requests will not be serviced (this is hard to do, TX buffer is pretty big)
     If there is a transmission issue, it is more likely the bus is full (Was not able to fill up the TX buffer under reasonable conditions during testing)
 - Good explanation of all of the HAL CAN settings:
     https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57094729/what-is-the-meaning-of-canbus-function-mode-initilazing-settings-for-stm32/57097908
 - Make sure to set the settings correctly when configuring in the CubeMX plugin
 - If the DLC on CAN Capture is >=64, then the RTR bit is set on that message
 - Check the STM_CAN repo for the file "F0xx CAN Config Settings.pptx" for the correct settings
 - For multiple GopherCAN busses, it will act as a single bus to the programmer, with a GopherCAN level routing table
 - Recommended to use Eclipses "highlight disabled code" feature to clearly show the preprocessor options
 - On the F7xx, the user will need to externally service the TX hardware in order to start the ISRs after a time of no messages being sent, as
     The interrupts are only called on the TX mailbox becomming open. This means a fuller TX buffer will be more efficient when sending messages

KNOWN BUGS:
 - float conversions do not work between F0 and F7
 - Filters are not working correctly (started when the general filter was added)
 - Filters completely mess up CAN2 when configuring multiple busses (something about sharing the filter banks)
 - CAN2 ISRs are broken with multi-bus
